In this case browser-level features like Google Chrome Sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. On iOS, if the user was signed in and the policy is set to \\Disabled\\ they will be signed out immediately. On other platforms, they will be signed out the next time they run Google Chrome.

If the policy is set to \\Enable browser sign-in,\\ then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser. On all platforms except iOS, the user is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Google Chrome Sync will be turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Google Chrome Sync, use the SyncDisabled policy. If the policy is set to \\Force browser sign-in\\ the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser.
